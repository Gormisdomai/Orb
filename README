This project contains the Arduino code and data feed parsers for the 
Orbs of Approximate Data.  

All that is needed to build the Orbs is the orb_of_approximate_data 
Arduino code.  You can point that code at the data sources hosted 
on 2552.com/orb, but please be reasonable and don't update more 
frequently than every 5 minutes.  The world doesn't change that fast anyway.

There will be change to the available data sources. Keep an eye on this
project's wiki for updates.

If you'd like to customize your own data sources, look at the code in 
./data_sources for examples.  You'd deploy these on your own server and
then configure the Orb code to point at them.  You can either do what I've 
done with the DJI code and update the served static file periodically via 
cron, or you can make them act like CGI scripts, fetching the data for 
each request from the Orb.

Get in touch if you have some specific data source that you'd like to see
and you don't have access to a server. 

FILES:

orb_of_approximate_data.pde: The Arduino code for the Orbs. 

data_sources/: The perl scripts that generate the data feeds for the Orb.

schematic/: Schematic files for the Orb.  Both the Eagle schematic and the
PDF printout of the wiring for the Orb are included.

bill_of_materials.txt: The things you need to buy.  Most of the components
in the project are flexible.  The only really essential thing is the 
AsyncLabs BlackWidow Arduino + wifi board.  Feel free to improvise on the rest.

build_instructions.txt: A step by step guide to making your own Orb.

prototype_board*: Snapshots of my prototyped setup for this project.  Very simple.
