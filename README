Arduino code and data feed parsers for the Orbs of Approximate Data.  All
that is needed to build the Orbs is the orb_of_approximate_data Arduino code.
You can point that code at the data sources hosted on 2552.com/orb, but please
be reasonable and don't update more frequently than every 5 minutes.  The world
doesn't change that fast anyway.

If you'd like to customize your own data sources, look at the code in 
./data_sources for examples.  You'd deploy these on your own server and
then configure the Orb code to point at them.  You can either do what I've 
done with the DJI code and update the served static file periodically via 
cron, or you can make them act like CGI scripts, fetching the data for 
each request from the Orb.

Get in touch if you have some specific data source that you'd like to see
and you don't have access to a server.

orb_of_approximate_data.pde: The Arduino code for the Orbs. 

data_sources/*: The perl scripts that generate the data feeds for the Orb.
